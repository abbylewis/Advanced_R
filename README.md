# Advanced-R (BIOL 6064)
Resources for a course on advanced topics in R programming for environmental data science

## Overview
In this seminar, we will discuss advanced topics in data science using the R statistical programming language, with biological and ecological applications. Topics will vary based on student interests, but will likely include code efficiency, functional programming, and reproducible workflows. 

## Learning objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
* Demonstrate an advanced understanding of R fundamentals (e.g., object types, environments, data storage)
* Predict which operations in R will be slow or memory-intensive, and describe ways of detecting and addressing these bottlenecks
* Identify technologies that enable collaborative coding and reproducibility
* Collaboratively create best practices for code efficiency, reproducibility, and documentation
* Explore and understand other advanced R topics as desired based on student interest 

## Texts
This class is based around the Advanced R textbook, written by Hadley Wickham, which is a great resource for diving in depth into some advanced concepts in R. The book is freely available online [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) (with solutions available [here](https://bookdown.org/Tazinho/Advanced-R-Solutions/)). Throughout the semester, we will likely also draw from other resources, depending on student interest.
